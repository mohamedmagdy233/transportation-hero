# Hero Laravel Application

Hero is a Laravel application designed to facilitate trips between clients and drivers. It provides a seamless and convenient platform for clients to order trips and for drivers to accept and manage these trips. Below are the details about the key features of the application:

## Features

### Client

- **Order a Trip**: Clients can easily order trips by specifying their pickup and drop-off locations.
- **Notification**: Once a trip is ordered, nearby drivers receive a notification.
- **Trip Management**: Clients can view the status of their trips and receive updates.

### Driver

- **Receive Trip Notifications**: Drivers in the vicinity of the client's location receive trip notifications.
- **Accept Trips**: The first driver to accept the trip gets assigned to it.
- **Trip Execution**: Drivers manage the trip, picking up the client and taking them to their destination.
